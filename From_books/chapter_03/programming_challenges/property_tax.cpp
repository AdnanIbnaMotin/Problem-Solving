/*
A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is 60 percent of the property's actual value.
If an acre of land is valued at $10,000, its assessment value is $6,000. The property tax is then 75Â¢ for each $100 of the
assessment value. The tax for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $45. Write a program that asks for the actual value of a
piece of property, then displays t he assessment value and property tax.
